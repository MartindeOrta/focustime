# FocusTime

**FocusTime** is a simple and minimalistic web app designed to help you stay focused during boring tasks or study sessions (yes, even the ones that make you want to cry).

🧠⏳ It works like a basic Pomodoro timer:

* **10 minutes of focus time** (you vs. distraction)
* **2 minutes of break** (stretch, breathe, maybe cry a little... then back to work)

## Features

* 🎯 **Default times**: 10 minutes for focus, 2 minutes for break
* ⚙️ **Customizable**: You can change the times in the settings
* 🔊 **Sound notification** when each time period ends
* 🖥️ 100% web-based — no downloads needed

## Why this app?

Because sometimes studying or working feels like watching paint dry. This little timer helps make the boring stuff more bearable by keeping you in short cycles of effort and rest.
